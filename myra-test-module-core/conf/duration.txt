Duration Data Type
The duration data type is used to specify a time interval.

The time interval is specified in the following form "PnYnMnDTnHnMnS" where:

P indicates the period (required)
nY indicates the number of years
nM indicates the number of months
nD indicates the number of days
T indicates the start of a time section (required if you are going to specify hours, minutes, or seconds)
nH indicates the number of hours
nM indicates the number of minutes
nS indicates the number of seconds
The following is an example of a duration declaration in a schema:

<xs:element name="period" type="xs:duration"/>
An element in your document might look like this:

Or it might look like this:

<period>P5Y2M10D</period>
The example above indicates a period of five years, two months, and 10 days.

Or it might look like this:

<period>P5Y2M10DT15H</period>
